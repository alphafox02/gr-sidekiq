sink_test.grc - Shows sidekiq_tx_block working
parameters:
    Card: Which sidekiq card in the chassis to use. 
            If you don't know, then when you run this, all the cards will be printed out which one is which.

    Handle ID: Which handle to use on the card.

    Threads: If 1, then running in tx_sync mode, if > 1 then running in tx_async mode.  
                Async mode can handle a faster sample rate then sync mode.

    Buffer Size: The size of the TX buffers.  Larger buffers will allow higher sample rates without underruns.                   But they introduce more delay between packet.

    Calibration Mode: Tx calibration will perform quad calibration, either in auto or manual.  
                        If manual then the run_tx_calibration button should be pressed when you want 
                        to manually run tx calibration.

    Run Cal: When set to 1, it will manually run calibration.


source_test.grc - Shows sidekiq_rx_block working

dual_source.grc - Shows 2 RX ports with sidekiq_rx_block

bursting.grc - Shows bursting transmit.  There is a message to stop and start the bursting feature. 
    The tx_block will assume no_bursting, but the edit message box will pass in, 
    buy default, a 1, which will turn on bursting capability.

tx_message.grc - Shows rate and frequency messages being sent into the tx_block.
